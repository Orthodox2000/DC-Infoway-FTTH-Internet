    <h1 class="section-title">Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions govern the use of services provided by
      <strong>DC Infoway Pvt. Ltd.</strong>. By subscribing to or using our
      internet, CCTV, or IT services, you agree to follow the terms below.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Service Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Our broadband and related services are intended for normal residential
      and business use. Any illegal activity, network abuse, hacking attempts,
      spam distribution, or unlawful downloads using our network are strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Plan Validity & Payments</h3>
    <p>
      All plans are prepaid unless otherwise agreed. Service validity depends
      on the selected plan duration. Services may be paused or suspended if payment
      is not received before expiry.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Installation & Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      Installation is subject to technical feasibility and site conditions.
      Routers, ONT devices, or cables provided may be chargeable, refundable,
      or rental-based depending on the plan. Damaged or lost equipment may be billed.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Speed & Connectivity</h3>
    <p>
      We aim to provide the best possible speed and uptime. However, actual
      Wi-Fi speed may vary depending on device quality, router placement,
      interference, and number of connected users. Wired connection gives the
      most accurate speed results.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Downtime & Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
      Occasional downtime may occur due to maintenance, fiber cuts, power issues,
      or upstream provider problems. We try to restore services as quickly as possible.
      Such downtime does not normally qualify for refunds.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Fair Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Plans are unlimited for regular usage. Extremely abnormal or commercial misuse,
      bandwidth reselling, or network exploitation may result in speed restriction
      or service suspension.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      Customers must provide correct contact details and safe access for installation
      and support visits. Internal wiring and power supply inside premises are the
      customer’s responsibility unless separately contracted.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Cancellation</h3>
    <p>
      Customers may choose not to renew after plan expiry. Mid-period cancellations
      generally do not qualify for refunds unless approved by management under special cases.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>
      These terms may be updated when required to match operational, regulatory,
      or service changes. Updated terms will apply going forward.
    </p>
